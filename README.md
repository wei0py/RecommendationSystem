# RecommendationSystem
This work presents a study on building a recommender system using the Amazon product review dataset. 
The goal of the system is to provide personalized recommendations to customers, based on their purchasing habits and preferences. The dataset used in this study contains millions of reviews and ratings of products sold on Amazon. 
The study investigated several approaches such as collaborative filtering to generate recommendations, where users are recommended products that are similar to those that they have previously rated highly. 
The performance of the system was evaluated using root mean squared error~(RMSE). The results show that the system is able to provide accurate and relevant recommendations to customers. 
However, there are also several ethical concerns that need to be considered, such as the privacy of customer data and the potential for bias in the recommendations made by the system.
The findings of this study have implications for both the design and implementation of recommender systems, as well as for the wider ethical considerations associated with the use of customer data in e-commerce platforms.
